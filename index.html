                <em>Before I started the Odin Project I had literally ZERO programming experience. <br> 
                    After almost exactly a year of working through the program, <br>
                 I was offered a job as a front end web developer. <br> 
                 Odin taught me all the most crucial skills in webdev <br>
                  and gave me an incredibly strong foundation <br>
                  for branching out and learning other pieces of <br>
                   the web-dev puzzle along the way.</em>
